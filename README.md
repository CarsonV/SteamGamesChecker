# SteamGamesChecker
Simple Discord bot to check what games you have shared with other members on your server

Current partially completed features:
- Allows users to add their steamid if their steam profile is public
- Gets all games for a user tied to the server the command is run on
- Allows users on the same server to view games up to 3 users share all together at one time

Hopefully more features and upgrades to come soon

Working on switchover to pycord from discord.py for slash commands.
